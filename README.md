# PROJ631 - ALGORITHMIQUE 

## Managing a bus network
A project that consists of managing a bus network in order to get the shortest, fastest and foremost way between two points. Points are represented by stop.      

### DETAILS  
3 files .py :
* Classes_in_regular.py :   
   * algorithms with regular timetables
 
* Classes_in_holidays.py :  
   * algorithms with holiday timetables
 
* manip_data.py : open .txt files which in there are all the timetables of lines  

2 files .txt :
* '1_Poisy-ParcDesGlaisins' : first line
* '2_Piscine-Patinoire_Campus' : second line  
 
these two txt are the table of all timetable that every stop has.

### How to launch
You can launch one of the Classes_in_regular.py or CLasses_in_holidays.py if you want to run it on holidays time or regular time.  



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Shortest way  
The shortest path between two points : concerning our case it's the shortest path between two stops.  

## Fastest way  
The fastest path between two points : it's the path where the number of stop coulb be important or not. It has to be the fastest in terms of time of travel between two stops.

## Foremost way  
The foremost path between two points : the path that arrives the earliest. The number of stop does not matter.
